# RPG

A small rpg I intend to work on when I have free time (currently in school).

So far I have: 
  - An inventory system for holding items. The middle mouse button drops the item when stored.
  - A tag that informs the player of what they are hovering over.
  - Mining/woodcutting are skills that the player can engage in and the resources are spawned after the rock or tree is depleted.
  - So far I have implemented scripts to handle item creation/destruction and you can pick them up and store them in your inventory.
