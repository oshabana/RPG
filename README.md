# RPG

A small rpg game I may (or may not) work on.

So far I have: 
  - An inventory system for holding items. The middle mouse button drops the item when stored
  - A tag that informs the player of what they are hovering over
  - Mining and woodcutting are skills that the player can engage in
  - So far I have implemented scripts to handle item creation/destruction and you can pick them up and store them in your           inventory
